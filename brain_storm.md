I find myself using a lot of time to plan:
    brainstorm questions:
        how can i save time each day
            automatically create a list of lists that is segmented into 24 elements that is changes to when something is filled in
    list of todos each day that are essentially constant each day
    a way to check off whether or not the todo was accomplished
        completion based productivity stats
            period per ananlysis?
            output to csv
    incorporate productivity ideas
        how much time did you actually spend in one place doing what activity?
        -calorie, macro input calculator
        -output calculator
    
    outputs the amount of time remaining in a day

    incorporate data visualization for all meaningful formats

    body composition stats tracker
    vitals tracker

        MR, Wake up routine, ER, sleep times, groceries, etc.

store every workout as a list
incorporate the python date module
use the iCal python module
use crons to send reminder emails (remember to turn on notifications)

define 

On second thought, thats too much intimate information into what my daily routine is.
    develope a pygame for starters and see where that leads you

Or create a modified calendar for turn in after you've perfected it for yourself
